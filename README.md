This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in F# related to mutable variables and tuple assignment.  The code showcases unexpected behavior when attempting to swap the values of mutable variables using a function that returns a tuple. The original variables remain unchanged even after the tuple swap.  The solution provides a corrected approach to achieve the desired value swapping.
